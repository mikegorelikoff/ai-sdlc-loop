# Prepare — ai-sdlc-loop-test-cases: Test Cases For Implementation

> Selector: prepare, clarify, or route

## Entry

Confirm the requested scope, flow mode, canonical workspace, required evidence, active lifecycle state, and safe runtime layout before acting.

## Procedure

### 0.1 Required Inputs

- Requirements, design, and behavior under test.
- Affected package, endpoint, provider, workflow, or contract.
- Known fixtures, mocks, and unavailable dependencies.

### 0.2 Clarification Rules

- Resolve discoverable facts and reuse inherited decisions before asking.
- Missing optional context stays optional; label assumptions explicitly.
- Pause only work dependent on a missing material input or conflicting requirement.

### 0.2.1 Flow Mode Flags

- Support `--quick-flow` and `--full-flow`; full takes precedence. Apply the shared execution contract below.


### 0.3 Output Rules

- Apply this skill’s Chat Output Contract to user-facing chat; keep native artifacts unchanged.
- Make findings, gaps, risks, and blockers explicit.
- Tie recommendations to evidence from the provided artifact, `specs-refiniment/<feature-name>/<file.md>` workspace, stakeholder context, or user-provided source material.
- Include role ownership when the output creates follow-up work for BA, QA, Dev, PM, or Delivery.
- Return progress, completion, validation, and handoff summaries directly in the active agent response.
- Before the final response, emit the `ai-sdlc-handoff/v2` contract with `result`, `blockers`, `next_required`, and `next_optional`; every action includes `reason`, `command`, and `expected_artifact`.
- Do not create `summary.txt`, `*-summary.txt`, or another standalone summary file unless the user explicitly requests one.
- Keep durable writes limited to the canonical lifecycle artifacts, decision log, human-readable index, and `_ai_sdlc` machine files.
- Let shared helpers migrate legacy paths on the next write; never overwrite or manually merge divergent legacy and canonical files.

### 0.4 Artifact Routing

- Maintain a feature decision log whenever this skill records, resolves, changes, or depends on a product, delivery, QA, security, validation, branching, implementation, or rollout decision.
- For PM, BA, QA, Delivery, discovery, planning, refinement, and readiness work, write decisions to `specs-refiniment/<feature-name>/decision-log.md`.
- For developer implementation SDD work, write decisions to `specs/<feature-name>/decision-log.md`.
- Each decision-log entry must include date, decision, context or evidence, options considered when relevant, owner, status, and links to affected artifacts, tasks, tests, or validation evidence.
- Use this exact decision-log structure:

  ```markdown
  # Decision Log

  | ID | Date | Status | Owner | Decision | Context/Evidence | Options Considered | Affected Artifacts | Validation/Trace Links |
  | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
  | DEC-001 | YYYY-MM-DD | proposed / accepted / superseded / rejected | role or name | concise decision | source facts, artifact links, or evidence | option A; option B; recommended default | affected docs, tasks, code, tests, or rollout notes | requirement IDs, test IDs, validation commands, PRs, commits, or tickets |
  ```

- When writing or updating files, place PM, BA, QA, Delivery, discovery, planning, refinement, and readiness artifacts at `specs-refiniment/<feature-name>/<file.md>`.
- Use the path pattern `specs-refiniment/<feature-name>/<file.md>`; choose a stable feature slug when known, otherwise use `tbd-<short-topic>` for `<feature-name>`.
- Do not write this skill's output into `specs/`; that folder is reserved for developer implementation SDD artifacts.
- If the user explicitly asks to convert a refined artifact into implementation work, hand off to `ai-sdlc-loop-specify`.

## 0.4.1 Runtime Path Resolution

- Treat `skills/` in commands as a logical skill root. In a harness source checkout, use `skills/`; in a project-scoped consumer installation, resolve it to `.agents/skills/`. Before running a helper, verify that the selected root contains both this skill and `ai-sdlc-loop-shared-runtime`; block with the missing path if neither layout exists.

## 0.5 Feature State Machine

Use `.ai-sdlc-loop/<feature>/spec.toon`, `state.toon`, approval receipts,
`quality-gate.toon` and `evidence.toon` for the fixed Loop lifecycle. Inspect
with the sibling runtime `loop.py status --feature <feature>`. Do not run the
Harness refinement state machine or mark optional planning helpers as completed
Loop stages. Source mutation, verification and commit keep their own gates.

## 0.6 Artifact Metadata And Metatags

Keep Loop-owned durable machine artifacts in canonical TOON. Let the owning
helper validate its schema and source fingerprints. Markdown metadata and
metatags apply only to explicitly requested compatible Harness artifacts; they
do not replace Loop receipts or require an additional artifact for ordinary work.

## 0.7 Specs Index

Read the active feature receipts first. Follow exact source paths, allowed
paths, changed files and trace IDs; do not scan every feature or require a
Harness specs index. Consume an existing SDD package only when supplied for
the task. A missing optional SDD package does not block the fixed Loop cycle.

## 0.8 Complete Refinement Cascade

- Trigger the complete cascade only when the user explicitly asks for a full, complete, or end-to-end spec refinement or asks for every refinement artifact. A normal `--full-flow` call for one skill remains single-stage.
- Before the first durable write, run `python3 skills/ai-sdlc-loop-shared-runtime/scripts/refinement_status.py --feature <feature-name> --gate full --format toon` and start with the earliest reported `next_skill`, including stages earlier than this skill.
- Execute the existing refinement skills in lifecycle order with `--full-flow`: discovery, PRFAQ, delivery-package gap review, requirements readiness, goal/capability mapping, backlog gap review, backlog decomposition, story decomposition, release slicing, BA context, delivery spec, QA plan, QA gap review, test strategy, test cases, test suite, QA readiness, and delivery handoff.
- Produce all 18 canonical Markdown artifacts. `release-slicing.md` is mandatory for a complete cascade; when release slicing is not applicable, write an explicit evidence-backed N/A artifact and complete the stage instead of skipping it.
- After every stage, finalize its artifact, record required decisions, mark the stage `done`, and refresh the refinement indexes before selecting the next skill.
- Do not declare the cascade complete until `python3 skills/ai-sdlc-loop-shared-runtime/scripts/refinement_status.py --feature <feature-name> --gate full --format markdown` exits successfully with `18/18`. If it fails, continue with the reported next skill or return the concrete blocker and remaining inventory in the active agent response.
- Surface checkpoint and final summaries in Codex only; never persist a cascade summary as a text file.

## Execution contract

Do not use it while requirements or test strategy still have blocking gaps. Use `ai-sdlc-loop-qa-requirements-gap-review` or `ai-sdlc-loop-test-scope-and-strategy-design` instead.

Read the [shared execution decisions](../../ai-sdlc-loop-shared-runtime/references/execution-contract.md) once for this invocation.
Apply its required/discoverable/inherited/optional input rules to this step's
declared inputs. Record the source and status of material facts, then validate
the owning output contract and current evidence before completion.

## Exit

Proceed only when inputs, authority, state prerequisites, artifact routes, and context boundaries are explicit; otherwise return the blocker or clarification.

## Chat presentation

Before a result, warning, blocker or question, apply the local [chat schema](../references/chat-output.toon) and the Chat Output Contract in `SKILL.md`. Preserve native artifact and tool-input formats.
